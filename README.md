# MarkAI - AI Model Benchmarking Tool

**Tagline:**  
A comprehensive tool to evaluate and compare AI model performance across multiple metrics.

---
# Note to the judges:

THIS IS JUST A PROTOTYPE PROJECT.

WE SETUP OUR OWN SERVER AN NO PRE-EXISTING API WAS USED
SERVER IS RUNNING OFF OF A 320GB HDD AND IS MODULAR
BASIC JS METHODS SUCH AS (FETCH) AND (FLASK) IN PYTHON WAS USED


## üöÄ Project Overview

**MarkAI** is a lightweight, user-friendly, web-based benchmarking tool built to assess the performance of AI models. It offers detailed insights into model behavior including accuracy, inference time, and system resource usage, making it ideal for developers, IT professionals, and researchers.

# HOW TO RUN
use vpn if this link is not accissible: http://markai.42web.io/?i=1

If it says unable to contact backend, please contact team Codestorm

_______________________OR_________________________
So in order to run this site simply go into "Backend folder and run {main.py}"
then go into INDEX.JS line 71 and modify server ip to local ip at port 5000

Then simply launch the index.html file
some .pt models have been provided in models folder
 NOTE: YOU WILL NEED TO INSTALL ALL MODULES REQUIRED IN REQUIREMENTS.TXT

## üß† Problem Statement

Build a lightweight web tool that allows users to upload AI models and receive quick performance insights such as:

- Accuracy  
- Inference time  
- Memory and resource usage

---

## üí° Solution

MarkAI provides a modern benchmarking framework with both automated metrics analysis and an option for human-in-the-loop validation, reducing AI bias and improving result accuracy.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Details

**Architecture:**  
Client-server architecture

- **Client:** Web interface for uploading models, running benchmarks, and viewing results.  
- **Server:** Backend engine that processes model files and computes performance metrics.

**Tech Stack:**

- **Backend:** Python (Flask)  
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- **Database:** SQLite  
- **Deployment:** Netlify

## üéÆ How to Use

1. Access the web application through the live site.  
2. Sign up or log in.  
3. Upload a model and dataset.  
4. Select benchmark type.  
5. View real-time metrics and download performance reports.
